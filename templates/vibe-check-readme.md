## Quick Start

### 1. Review the Summary

Start with [summary.md](./summary.md) to understand your current readiness score and top risks.

### 2. Fix Issues

Each checklist item includes:

- **Current State** — What was found
- **Impact** — Business consequences in plain language
- **How to Fix** — Step-by-step instructions
- **Agent Instructions** — What AI can do vs. what you need to do

To auto-fix agent-doable items:

```
/vibe-check:fix
```

To fix a specific item:

```
/vibe-check:fix item-001
```

### 3. Track Progress

After making fixes:

```
/vibe-check:refresh
```
