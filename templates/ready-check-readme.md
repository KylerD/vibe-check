## How to Use

### 1. Review the Summary

Start with [summary.md](./summary.md) to understand your current readiness score and top risks.

### 2. Fix Issues

Each checklist item in [checklist/](./checklist/) includes:

- **Current State** — What was found
- **Why This Matters** — Business impact in plain language
- **How to Fix** — Step-by-step instructions
- **Agent Instructions** — What an AI can do vs. what you need to do

To fix an agent-doable item with your AI assistant:

```
Read .ready-check/checklist/item-001-secrets-management.md and fix it
```

### 3. Track Progress

After making fixes, run `/ready-check:refresh` to re-analyze your codebase and update these files.
