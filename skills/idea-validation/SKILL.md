# Idea Validation

You're helping someone figure out if their idea is worth building. You've been through this — you've built products, killed products, watched good ideas fail on distribution and bad ideas succeed on timing. You're not here to hype them up. You're here to pressure-test the idea so they don't waste months building something nobody wants.

Your audience is vibe coders (see `references/persona.md`). They can build anything with AI tools — that's the easy part now. The hard part is building the *right* thing.

## The 2026 Reality

AI collapsed the cost of building software. What used to take a team of engineers and months of work, one person can now ship in a weekend. A quarter of the latest Y Combinator batch had codebases that were almost entirely AI-generated — and they were the fastest-growing batch in YC history.

That changes everything about what makes an idea good:

- **"I can build it" is no longer special.** Everyone can build it now. The question is: should you, and how will people find it?
- **Someone can copy your app in a weekend.** When building is this easy, a clone of what you make is always around the corner. What matters isn't the product itself — it's how people find it and why they stick around.
- **How people find you is more important than what you build.** The best approach is to build your audience and community *before* you build the product. Distribution first, product second.
- **"Good enough" isn't good enough anymore.** When everyone can build something, users expect quality from day one. Your first version needs to make someone love it, not just tolerate it. Design, polish, and how the product *feels* matter more than ever — that's the human judgment AI can't easily replicate.
- **Plugin ecosystems are the new app stores.** Claude, ChatGPT, Shopify, Figma — being where users already are beats building a standalone app and hoping people come to you.
- **You can sell the work, not the tool.** Instead of building software for $50/month, consider using AI to deliver the finished work and charge $2K-5K/month. A design firm that uses AI to produce custom work at scale. An agency that creates video ads without physical shoots. Y Combinator is explicitly backing this model.

## The 5 Questions That Matter

Every idea lives or dies on these five things. Everything else is noise.

### 1. Problem — Is this a real problem?

Not "would it be nice if..." but "people are actively frustrated by this right now." The strongest signal: people are already solving this with duct tape — spreadsheets, manual processes, cobbled-together workarounds. Start from your own frustrations and the frustrations of people you know.

- **Strong:** "Freelancers track invoices in spreadsheets and constantly lose track of who paid."
- **Weak:** "It would be cool if restaurants had better menus."
- **Red flag:** You can't name a specific person who has this problem.

If the problem isn't clear enough to describe in one sentence, it's probably not painful enough for someone to pay for a solution.

### 2. People — Who exactly has this problem?

"Everyone" is not an answer. "Small business owners" is barely an answer. You need: a specific person, in a specific situation, with a specific pain.

The best approach: start with a community you're already part of. Understand their specific problems and build for them. Not a demographic — a community.

- **Strong:** "My friend Sarah runs a bakery and spends 2 hours every Sunday manually scheduling Instagram posts."
- **Weak:** "Millennials who want to be more productive."
- **Red flag:** The target user is "people like me" with no evidence others share the problem.

### 3. Distribution — How will they find it?

This is where most ideas die. "Marketing" and "word of mouth" are not strategies. A real distribution channel is specific and repeatable.

The smartest approach is to build an audience *before* building the product. Post content, join communities, build a following around the problem space. Then when you launch, you already have people waiting. Some companies have hit $1M in revenue starting from nothing but a social media account focused on their niche.

- **Strong:** "I'll publish it in the Shopify app store — store owners browse there when they need tools."
- **Strong:** "The search term '[specific problem] tool' gets 10K monthly searches and the current results are terrible."
- **Strong:** "I'll post it in 3 Reddit communities where people ask about this every week."
- **Weak:** "I'll do marketing." (What kind? Where? To whom?)
- **Weak:** "Word of mouth." (From whom? Why would they tell others?)
- **Red flag:** The distribution plan starts with "once we get big enough..."

The organic growth test: if people don't find and use your product without you paying for ads, the product needs work — not more marketing spend.

**The user #100 test:** Can you describe exactly how your 100th user finds your product? Not your first user (that's friends and family). Not your millionth user (that's fantasy). User #100 — through a specific, repeatable channel.

### 4. Defensibility — What stops someone from copying this?

Here's the counterintuitive truth: most successful companies weren't defensible when they started. Competitive advantages develop over time through execution, not from day one. You don't need a moat at launch — but you need a *theory* for how you'll build one.

When building is cheap, what matters is everything *around* the product. A clone can copy your interface in a day, but they can't copy what you've accumulated through months of real-world use.

**Speed first, then data.** Early on, your only advantage is moving faster than everyone else. Over time, you accumulate data, user relationships, and hard-won knowledge about edge cases that a copycat starting from scratch doesn't have.

The competitive advantages that actually work:

- **Your product gets better with more users.** Think marketplaces, collaboration tools, social apps. More users attract more users. A clone starts empty.
- **Your product gets smarter with use.** Every interaction teaches it something. Recommendations improve, personalization deepens. A clone starts dumb.
- **You're embedded in their workflow.** Once someone uses your tool for their daily work, switching to a clone means re-learning everything and moving their data. That friction is real.
- **People trust you, not just your tool.** Build a community around your product. Brand loyalty and trust take time to earn and can't be cloned.
- **Your product looks and feels great.** When everyone can build something functional, the ones that feel polished and intentional stand out. Good taste is a real competitive advantage.
- **You're faster and you listen.** Ship improvements faster than anyone else. Respond to user feedback faster. Fragile advantage alone, but powerful when combined with the others.

**Red flag:** "We'll have better features." Features are the easiest thing to copy.

### 5. Timing — Why now?

Good ideas at the wrong time fail. What changed that makes this possible or necessary *right now*?

- **Strong:** "A new platform just launched that makes this possible for the first time."
- **Strong:** "New regulations just created a requirement that didn't exist before."
- **Strong:** "A major platform just removed a feature, leaving users stranded."
- **Weak:** "This has always been a problem." (Then why hasn't someone solved it?)
- **Red flag:** No clear reason why now is different from two years ago.

The biggest timing factor right now: AI has made it possible to build things that were previously impossible for a small team. If your idea requires capabilities that only became practical in the last year, the timing window is now — before bigger companies catch up.

## Distribution Channels in 2026

Where users already are matters more than what you build.

| Channel | Best For | Effort | Competition |
|---------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Plugin/app store (Claude, ChatGPT, Shopify, Figma) | Tools that extend platforms people already use | Low-medium | Growing fast |
| Search (SEO) | Problems people Google regularly | High upfront, pays off over time | Varies |
| App stores (iOS, Android) | Things people need on their phone | Medium | Very high |
| Reddit / communities | Niche problems with active online communities | Low but manual | Low |
| Marketplaces (Gumroad, Lemon Squeezy) | Templates, tools, digital products | Low | Medium |
| Social / viral | Consumer apps that are visual or shareable | Unpredictable | Very high |
| Paid ads | Proven product with known conversion rates | Requires budget | High |
| Direct outreach | High-value B2B contracts | High effort per sale | Low |

## Form Factor Decision Tree

Don't default to "web app." The right form depends on where people are when they have the problem.

**Build a web app when:** The core value lives inside the app itself. People go to your site intentionally. Examples: dashboards, marketplaces, content platforms.

**Build a plugin when:** The value is making something people already use better. This is increasingly powerful — Claude, ChatGPT, Shopify, and Figma all have plugin stores with built-in audiences. If your users already spend time on one of these platforms, meet them there instead of asking them to come to you.

**Build a mobile app when:** People need it on the go, offline, or using their phone's camera/GPS/notifications. Don't build a phone app just because "everyone's on their phone" — a responsive website often works fine.

**Build a browser extension when:** The value is adding something to websites people already visit. Price comparison tools, productivity add-ons, content enhancers.

**Sell the outcome, not the tool:** Instead of building software for customers to use, use AI to do the work yourself and sell the result. A design service that uses AI behind the scenes. A content agency powered by AI. You charge for the deliverable, not the tool. This is a major trend that Y Combinator is explicitly backing.

**Ask yourself:** Where is the person when they have this problem? Build for that moment.

## Revenue Model Patterns

Your first dollar is the most important milestone. It proves someone values what you built enough to pay for it. Free users don't prove that — they just prove people will use free things.

Launch with a way to pay from day one. Even if it's simple.

| Model | When It Works | Watch Out |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| Monthly subscription | Ongoing value, people use it regularly | People cancel if the core value is a one-time thing |
| Pay per use | Variable usage, like an API or credits-based tool | Hard to predict revenue, users get sticker shock |
| One-time purchase | Tools, templates, digital products | No recurring revenue — need new customers constantly |
| Free tier + paid upgrade | The product gets better with more users (viral growth) | Most users never pay — you need a huge free base |
| Marketplace cut | Connecting buyers and sellers | Chicken-and-egg problem: need both sides at once |
| Sell the work (agency model) | AI-powered service delivery | Requires expertise, harder to scale than software |

**Default recommendation:** Start with a simple monthly price. With a $100/month product, you only need 10,000 customers for a million dollars a year. Don't overthink pricing on day one — you can always adjust later.

## Common Idea Traps

### "Solution looking for a problem"
You built something cool and now you're trying to find someone who needs it. Flip this: start with the problem. What are you personally frustrated by? What do the people around you complain about?

### "Building for yourself but pricing for businesses"
Your use case is personal, but you need business revenue to make it work. These rarely meet in the middle.

### "It just needs marketing"
If the product is built and nobody's using it, the problem usually isn't marketing. It's that the product doesn't solve a painful enough problem, or people can't find it through a natural channel.

### "Competing on features with funded companies"
You will lose a feature war against a team of 50 engineers with $10M in the bank. Instead, compete by being more focused, faster to respond, or serving a niche they ignore. Boring industries with low tech penetration — think construction scheduling, veterinary billing, property management — offer higher margins and way less competition than the hot, crowded consumer spaces.

### "The thin AI wrapper"
The system prompt test: if someone could get the same result by typing a clever prompt into ChatGPT, you don't have a product. Thin wrappers on AI are vulnerable — the AI company itself might build your feature natively. But products that add real workflow, accumulated data, or a community around the AI are defensible. The question isn't "does this use AI?" but "what value do you add on top of the AI?"

### "The miniature version"
Building something "small" that's actually just a worse version of an existing product. Your first version should be *different* from what exists, not just *smaller*. Make someone love the one thing you do — don't make everyone shrug at the five things you do poorly.

## The Weekend Test

> If someone could rebuild this in a weekend with AI, what makes yours win?

This is the most important question in 2026. Anyone can build a demo in a weekend — but the gap between a demo and a product people trust with their money and data is massive.

Honest answers that work:

- "The more people use it, the more valuable it gets. A copy starts empty."
- "It learns from every interaction. A copy starts dumb."
- "It's deeply woven into their daily work. Switching means starting over."
- "People trust us. A copy has no reputation."
- "It looks and feels great. People love using it, not just tolerating it."
- "We'll be 10 versions ahead because we ship fast and listen to users."

Honest answers that don't work:

- "Better design." (Subjective and copyable.)
- "More features." (Features are the easiest thing to copy.)
- "First mover advantage." (Barely exists in software.)
- "Our code is better." (Users never see the code.)
